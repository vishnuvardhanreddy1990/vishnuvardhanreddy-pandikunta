This project focuses on building a QA system using the SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) to evaluate and answer questions accurately. Leveraging advanced transformer models like T5 from HuggingFace, the system will be fine-tuned to improve performance and accuracy in extracting relevant answers from the provided context.\n","\n","#### **About the Dataset**\n","\n","The SQuAD dataset is a widely used benchmark for training and evaluating QA models. It consists of over 100,000 question-answer pairs, derived from Wikipedia articles. Each entry includes a passage of text (context) and associated questions, with the corresponding answers highlighted within the context. This dataset provides a diverse range of topics and question types, making it an ideal resource for training a robust and generalizable QnA model.\n","\n","#### **Aim**\n","\n","The aim of this project is to develop and fine-tune a QnA system using the T5 model from HuggingFace on the SQuAD dataset. The objectives include:\n","\n","- Preprocessing and tokenizing the dataset to prepare it for model training.\n","- Fine-tuning the T5 model to enhance its performance in answering questions based on the given contexts.\n","- Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.\n","- Demonstrating the practical application of advanced transformer models in QnA systems."],"metadata":{"id":"XO_jWj5Jeht2"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"N_SFNDrZVuus"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Instal Dependencies**\n","\n","- `transformers`: For working with transformer models.\n","- `datasets`: For accessing and handling datasets.\n","- `evaluate`: For evaluating model performance.\n","- `rouge`: For calculating ROUGE scores in text summarization tasks."],"metadata":{"id":"Y40E7c3beKEx"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"02LsUE6hIcyk"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Install dependencies\n","!pip install transformers\n","!pip install datasets\n","!pip install evaluate\n","!pip install rouge\n","\n","# Clear the output\n","from IPython.display import clear_output\n","clear_output()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Import Python Libraries**"],"metadata":{"id":"y0CUb3XYjRvo"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Import python modules\n","import torch\n","import json\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","from torch.optim import Adam\n","import nltk\n","import spacy\n","import string\n","import evaluate\n","from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader, RandomSampler\n","import pandas as pd\n","from datasets import load_dataset\n","import numpy as np\n","import transformers\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5Model, T5ForConditionalGeneration, T5TokenizerFast\n","\n","# To ignore unnecessary warnings\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")"],"metadata":{"id":"QdUCSmbiL69m"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Load SQUAD Dataset: QnA**"],"metadata":{"id":"opoCr_xWjWCS"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Load SQUAD Question-Answering Data: Considering 10000 samples out of 100000 (10% of whole data) for smoother training\n","\n","squad_data = load_dataset(\"squad\", split=\"train[:10000]\")\n","squad_data"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4AqSvnAoJgbT","outputId":"dbbf953f-59d3-4ee5-d82c-c131fc0cee18"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Dataset({\n","    features: ['id', 'title', 'context', 'question', 'answers'],\n","    num_rows: 10000\n","})"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":29}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Show the first sample from the train set\n","squad_data = squad_data.train_test_split(test_size=0.2)\n","squad_data"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"anLJu0MpJy67","outputId":"4e17f68d-1ee3-4982-88e4-093da6e57b81"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["DatasetDict({\n","    train: Dataset({\n","        features: ['id', 'title', 'context', 'question', 'answers'],\n","        num_rows: 8000\n","    })\n","    test: Dataset({\n","        features: ['id', 'title', 'context', 'question', 'answers'],\n","        num_rows: 2000\n","    })\n","})"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":30}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Show the first sample from the train set\n","squad_data[\"train\"][0]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"c1YOK3EgJ58H","outputId":"1715ffbd-251b-4aa1-ada1-f47aff612c55"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'id': '573406cd4776f41900661729',\n"," 'title': 'Portugal',\n"," 'context': 'Travel and tourism continue to be extremely important for Portugal, with visitor numbers forecast to increase significantly in the future.[citation needed] However, the increasing competition from Eastern European destinations continues to develop, with the presence of similar attractions that are often cheaper in countries such as Croatia.

In some places, however, such as in rural areas of Poland, dog fat is believed to have medicinal properties—being good for the lungs for instance.

It is estimated that 13–16 million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every year. Other cultures, such as Polynesia and pre-Columbian Mexico, also consumed dog meat in their history. However, Western, South Asian, African, and Middle Eastern cultures, in general, regard consumption of dog meat as taboo. In some places, however, such as in rural areas of Poland, dog fat is believed to have medicinal properties—being good for the lungs for instance. Dog meat is also consumed in some parts of Switzerland.
